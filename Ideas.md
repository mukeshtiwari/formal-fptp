1. Implement  A Formal Analysis of the Neuchatel e-Voting Protocol  (https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8406615)
   in Lean/Coq theorem prover. Can it lead to a publication (no idea)

2. A Formal Security Analysis of the Signal Messaging Protocol https://eprint.iacr.org/2016/1013.pdf. Turn this in 
   to a verified code. What would the proofs look like? No idea

3. Formally Verified Cryptographic Web Applicationsin WebAssembly https://eprint.iacr.org/2019/542.pdf. Took the idea 
  from second paper and turn the symbolic model into F*. Implement it into Lean/Coq and see how it goes. 
  The problem with me is that I do not know how would they return into a paper.
